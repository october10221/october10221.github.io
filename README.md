# TOEIC Zombie Vocabulary Game

TOEIC Zombie is a simple web-based vocabulary quiz designed to help you practice common TOEIC words in a fun way. The application is written in plain HTML, Tailwind CSS (via CDN) and JavaScript. Questions appear one at a time and you must choose the correct Thai translation before time runs out or the zombie catches you!

- Four multiple-choice options for each word with colorful animated buttons
- 3‑second countdown timer with a zombie emoji that grows larger as time ticks down

- A summary of any incorrect answers when the game ends
- Works entirely in the browser, no server setup required
